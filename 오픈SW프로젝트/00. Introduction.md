# ðŸ–¥ Introduction

## Computer Vision?

A feild that includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images, as the human being does.


## Computer Vision and Image Processing

- Computer Vision begins with Image Processing !
- Computer Vision: all techniques for enabling a *computer to see a real-world using images* as the human being does.
- Image Processing: all fundamental techniques for image

### Low-level computer vision


- Image enhancement/restoration (noisy image â†’ high quality image)
- Image filtering
- Computational photography ( â†’ High Dynamic Range image)
- Image registration (alignment)

### Middle-level computer vision


- Image segmentation (extract foreground from the background)
- Contour detection (extract contour from the object)
- Image descriptor
- 3D reconstruction (multiple pictures of the same scene â†’ 3D model)

### High-level computer vision


- Object classification/recognition (region belongs to person, dog or chair)
- Object localization (find what kind of objects are in the scene & estimate precise location)
- Visual question & answering
- Scene understanding (whether this pixel belongs to specific object in the scene)
